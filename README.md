# Posts - A Simplified Social Media Platform

Posts is a minimalistic clone of https://posts.cv/, which is itself a simplified and scaled-down alternative to Twitter. We built this clone solely for educational purposes. The app includes the following features:

- User authentication
- Ability to create text, image, or combined posts
- Ability to follow other users
- Ability to like and comment on posts
- "Highlights" tab: posts from those you follow
- "Everyone" tab: all posts in reverse chronological order

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the terminal at the root of the repository.
3. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
4. Run the app with `pnpm dev`.
